Hi, I’m Michal Wrobel👋

I’m a software engineer💻 interested in all sorts of things.

I've worked on many projects across different business units. Recently, I've been working in startups🚀 where I was involved in everything.

What I enjoy most is building products from inception to production🛠️.
I also have an interest in data and infrastructure.
